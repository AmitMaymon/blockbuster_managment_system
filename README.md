This is a project i was given to do,
Its like a blockbuster management platform,
every user has permissions set by the admin of what actions
can the user do or browse.

While it is not the prettiest project it is complex,
there are 2 servers , 2 databases ,2 local JSON files set up. And 2 API calls for JSONplaceholder and TVmaze.

Demo Site- not available yet!

Instructions are in a pdf file in this repo.
The instructions are not very clear but i did my best to deliver the work, with consultation of what is needed with the project giver.



Let me know what you think!
